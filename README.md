Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is an innovative field within machine learning that focuses on identifying human emotions based on vocal cues in audio recordings. This project aims to develop a robust SER system using various machine learning algorithms, leveraging audio data to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and neutrality.
Project Overview
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a model capable of recognizing emotions from speech signals. By analyzing the tone, pitch, and modulation of voice, the model will be trained to classify emotions accurately. This technology has significant applications in customer service, mental health monitoring, and interactive voice response systems.
Dataset
For this project, we utilize well-known datasets such as the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) and the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS). These datasets contain thousands of audio samples recorded by professional actors expressing various emotions. The RAVDESS dataset includes 7356 files rated for emotional validity and intensity by multiple individuals, ensuring high-quality training data.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The audio files are preprocessed to extract relevant features that can help in emotion recognition. Commonly used features include:
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs): These capture the power spectrum of the audio signal.
Chroma features: These relate to the energy distribution across different pitches.
Spectral features: These provide information about the frequency content of the audio.
Model Selection: Various machine learning models can be employed for SER, including:
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forests
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)
Deep Learning Models: Such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for more complex temporal dependencies in speech data.
Training and Evaluation: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance accurately. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess how well the model performs in classifying emotions.
Implementation
The implementation involves using Python libraries such as:
Librosa: For audio processing and feature extraction.
Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models.
TensorFlow/Keras: For deep learning approaches.
Results
Upon training the model with the selected datasets, initial results indicate promising accuracy levels. For instance, an MLPClassifier achieved an accuracy of approximately 72.4% on the test set. However, further tuning and experimentation with different algorithms may enhance performance.
Applications
The applications of SER technology are vast:
Customer Service: Enhancing interactions by adjusting responses based on detected emotions.
Mental Health: Monitoring emotional states through voice analysis.
Interactive Voice Assistants: Enabling more empathetic responses in AI-driven conversations.
Conclusion
This Speech Emotion Recognition project showcases the potential of machine learning in understanding human emotions through voice analysis. By utilizing advanced algorithms and comprehensive datasets, we aim to create a system that not only recognizes but also responds appropriately to human emotions in various applications. The continuous evolution of SER technology promises to improve human-computer interaction significantly, making it a vital area for future research and development.
